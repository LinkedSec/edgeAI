# edgeAI
This is an open-source tool to generate tailored c-code for embedded devices.
The code can be used to deploy deep neural networks, qp-solvers and more
for several  applications like control, image recognition, etc.

## Getting Started
A small example is provided which generates executable c-code for a neural network.
Just open a terminal and run
'''
python example.py
'''
or
'''
run example.py
'''
from an ipython console.

### Installing
There is no installation needed, just make sure that you have installed
